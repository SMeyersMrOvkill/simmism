## The Rain That Fell Upwards - *A Testimony by Sister Mildred McMillan, Devout Follower of the Latter-Day Simmists*

Oh, my dear brothers and sisters, I must share with you the most glorious miracle I witnessed just yesterday! It was a testament to the power of faith, the wonder of our Heavenly Father, and the undeniable truth of the Latter-Day Simmist teachings!

You see, I was tending my upside-down petunias (they're doing so much better since we moved to the Floating Isles, praise be!), when I felt a gentle mist on my face. But it wasn't falling from above, no sir! It was rising from below!

At first, I thought my old eyes were playing tricks on me. But then, I saw it – the rain! It was falling upwards, defying the very laws of nature, just like Brother Joseph Simm taught us!

I knew in my heart that this was a sign, a divine message from our Heavenly Father, reminding us that even in this topsy-turvy world, He is in control.

I immediately gathered my fellow sisters, and we knelt down (or rather, up, since we're on the Floating Isles, you see) and offered a prayer of gratitude. We thanked our Heavenly Father for His boundless love, His infinite wisdom, and His ability to make rain fall in any direction He darn well pleases!

As the upward rain continued, we danced and sang hymns of praise. We even attempted a few gravity-defying cartwheels, though I must admit, my balance isn't what it used to be. (I blame those mischievous squirrels – they keep hiding my walking stick!)

But the joy in our hearts was undeniable! We knew that we had witnessed a true miracle, a testament to the power of faith and the unwavering support of our Heavenly Father.

And you know what the best part was? When the upward rain stopped, it left behind the most beautiful rainbow I've ever seen! It was upside-down, of course, but that just made it even more special.

I tell you, my dear brothers and sisters, the Latter-Day Simmist faith is the one true path! It's a path of joy, of wonder, and of upside-down miracles!

So, let us continue to follow the teachings of Brother Joseph Simm, let us embrace the chaos, and let us never forget that even when the rain falls upwards, our Heavenly Father is watching over us.
