## The Council of Whimsy - *A Somewhat Disjointed Account by a Simm with a Penchant for Tranquility and a Distraction or Two Along the Way*

Right, so, the Council of Whimsy. Yeah, it's a thing. A big thing, apparently. They make the decisions, you see. For all of Simm City. Important decisions.  

Like, should we paint the Upside-Down City turquoise? Or maybe chartreuse? Oh, but chartreuse clashes with the squirrels, apparently. Grug had a whole presentation on it.  With interpretive dance. And a PowerPoint.

Wait, where was I going with this? Ah, yes, the Council.  Important people.  Very wise.  They meet in a giant bouncy castle. It's official.  Zenith made it a law.  Said it promotes "flexible thinking."  I think it just makes him giggle.

They use a lot of props, the Council.  Dice, mostly.  And a magic 8-ball. Horace the potted plant gets a vote too.  He's surprisingly opinionated for a plant.  Especially about fertilizer. 

Decisions are... interesting.  One day, they decided everyone had to wear hats made of bananas.  Another day, they banned the word "Tuesday."  It's all very random.  And surprisingly effective. 

I think I lost my train of thought again.  Oh well.  The Council of Whimsy, it's a thing.  A weird, wonderful, slightly chaotic thing.  And somehow, it works.  Simm City wouldn't be the same without it.  

Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I need a nap.  All this decision-making is exhausting.
