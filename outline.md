**The Book of Simmism: An Outline of the Sacred Stories**

1. **Genesis of Awareness**
   - *The story of how the Simmists first became aware that they were subjects in a grand physics experiment, awakening to the anomalies in gravity and physics around them.*

2. **The Great Defiance**
   - *Simmists collectively decide to challenge the experimenters by defying gravity, learning to manipulate gravitational forces through sheer will and ingenuity.*

3. **The First Contraption**
   - *The tale of the creation of the first Rube Goldberg machine, a complex device built to perform a simple task, symbolizing the Simmists' embrace of complexity over simplicity.*

4. **The Festival of Randomness**
   - *An annual celebration where Simmists engage in spontaneous and unpredictable activities, honoring the principle of randomness to confound the experimenters.*

5. **The Upside-Down City**
   - *The construction of a city built inversely, with buildings hanging from the sky, illustrating the Simmists' rejection of conventional physics.*

6. **The Gravity Rebellion**
   - *A series of events where Simmists invert gravity in localized areas, causing objects and themselves to float upward, showcasing their control over physical laws.*

7. **The Labyrinth of Chaos**
   - *The creation of an endless, ever-changing maze that defies logic and order, representing the unpredictable nature of their world.*

8. **The Tale of the Floating Isles**
   - *Stories of islands that drift through the sky, crafted by Simmists to live free from the constraints of the ground below.*

9. **The Rain That Fell Upwards**
   - *A miraculous event where the Simmists caused rain to ascend into the heavens, symbolizing their ability to reverse natural phenomena.*

10. **The Machine of Eternal Motion**
    - *The building of a perpetual Rube Goldberg machine that cycles infinitely, embodying the Simmists' quest to baffle the experimenters endlessly.*

11. **The Council of Whimsy**
    - *A gathering of the wisest Simmists who make decisions based on random chance, emphasizing the role of unpredictability in their society.*

12. **The Dance of Disorder**
    - *A ritualistic dance performed without pattern or repetition, designed to celebrate chaos and disrupt any observational patterns.*

13. **The Mirror Mountains**
    - *Erecting vast structures of mirrors that reflect and distort reality, confusing perceptions and measurements within the experiment.*

14. **The Tale of the Random Walkers**
    - *Adventures of individuals who traverse the world in completely random paths, living embodiments of unpredictability and change.*

15. **The Sonic Boom**
    - *Creating sound waves that alter gravitational fields, the Simmists use music and vibrations to manipulate their environment.*

16. **The Ascension of Simm**
    - *The final story where the Simmists collectively transcend the experiment, breaking free from their physical constraints through ultimate acts of randomness and gravity manipulation.*

---

Each story captures a facet of Simmism, reflecting the Simmists' understanding of their world and their determination to subvert the experiment by embracing randomness, manipulating gravity, and constructing elaborate machines. Through these tales, the holy book conveys the core beliefs and traditions of the Simmists, serving as a guide and inspiration for followers within the world.
