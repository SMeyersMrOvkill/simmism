## Genesis of Awareness

Brog, a being of habit and a staunch believer in the unwavering steadfastness of bricks, found himself blinking, not once, but thrice, at the spectacle unfolding before his very eyes.  Now, Brog, you see, was a builder, or perhaps more accurately, a stacker.  He possessed an almost preternatural ability to coax bricks into perfectly aligned rows, to erect walls that stood as testaments to the immutable laws of gravity.  He found a certain comfort, a reassuring predictability, in the way things settled, solid and unyielding, precisely where he placed them. 

It was, therefore, with no small amount of consternation that he observed the aforementioned brick, a perfectly ordinary brick, mind you, refusing to behave in a perfectly ordinary brick-like manner.  He had, with his own two hands, placed it atop the partially constructed edifice that constituted his neighbor Grug's latest... endeavor.  Grug, you see, was an "ideas" Simm, prone to bouts of inspiration that manifested as peculiar arrangements of found objects and occasionally involved balancing teapots on his nose while humming melodies discernible only to nocturnal flying mammals.

This particular brick, however, seemed to have missed the memo on the fundamental principles of downward trajectory.  Instead of plummeting earthward with the resolute finality that Brog had come to expect from bricks, it hovered.  It lingered in the air, not falling, not quite floating, but existing in a state of suspended animation that defied both logic and Brog's understanding of the physical world. 

Across the way, Grug, who had been engaged in his aforementioned teapot-balancing and bat-song serenade, abruptly ceased his activities.  The teapot, in a feat of inexplicable physics, remained perched precariously upon his nasal appendage.  His eyes, wide with a mixture of bewilderment and dawning comprehension, fixed upon the errant brick.

"Well, now," Grug remarked, his voice a low rumble that seemed to emanate from his very core, "That's a turnip I wasn't expecting in the stew of reality."

And with that, the seeds of awareness were sown. The Simmists, though they wouldn't adopt that moniker until much later, perhaps after a particularly rousing game of charades, had stumbled upon the first, unsettling clue that their existence was not as it seemed.  The ground beneath their feet, both literally and metaphorically, had begun to tremble, and the universe, it seemed, was about to become a much stranger place.
